# Mushroom Flow

The Mushroom Flow refers to the airflow around mushrooms, as observed in fluid dynamics. It was proposed by a Japanese person in 2024 as a sort of parody when the concept of "Bamboo Shoot Potential" discovered by AI was trending. Due to its quirky phrasing, it became popular online alongside Bamboo Shoot Potential.

## Overview

Mushroom Flow is not a new concept or discovery — it is, quite literally, "the airflow around a mushroom." There's nothing particularly noteworthy about it.

However, with the increasing accessibility of high-performance computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for personal use, there has been a rise in detailed data and images analyzing airflow around 3D models of mushrooms. The very act of seriously analyzing something so mundane (likely by professionals) is enjoyed as a form of surreal, collective humor.

## Fundamental Differences from Bamboo Shoot Potential

As noted at the beginning, Mushroom Flow became popular around the same time as Bamboo Shoot Potential. Because the latter was introduced as a discovery made by AI, Mushroom Flow is often mistakenly grouped together with it.

However, Mushroom Flow was a parody in response to Bamboo Shoot Potential, proposed by a human (as a joke), not by AI.

Moreover, although Bamboo Shoot Potential appears trivial at first glance, it presents a new perspective and insight into a previously unexamined topic — the relationship between the weight of a load and the maximum height a bamboo shoot can push it.

In contrast, Mushroom Flow introduces no new abstract viewpoint or novel results. It merely applies well-known techniques to a known shape, and is thus no more than an example of applying existing technology.

For that reason, despite the frequent confusion, the two should be clearly distinguished in terms of their significance.

## The Unique Relationship Between Bamboo Shoots and Mushrooms in Japan

To understand the background behind the creation and popularity of the term "Mushroom Flow," it's important to know that in Japan, "bamboo shoots" carry a special cultural meaning, often paired with "mushrooms."

There are popular Japanese snacks themed around mushrooms and bamboo shoots, so well-known that nearly every Japanese person has eaten them at least once.

This has led to a long-standing, playful rivalry between fans of the two snacks. While entirely in jest, people often engage in debates over which one is better, playfully teasing the opposing "faction."

Therefore, when the concept of Bamboo Shoot Potential — proposed by AI — went viral worldwide (not because of its content, but because of its AI origin), those aligned with the "mushroom faction" felt they couldn't sit idly by. Of course, this was all part of the elaborate joke.

Within this context of the classic "mushroom vs. bamboo shoot" debate, the term "Mushroom Flow" was coined. While the actual origins are unclear, it is widely believed that the phrase came first, and its definition — "the flow of air around mushrooms" — was retrofitted later.

## Evaluation by AI

To legitimize Mushroom Flow as a concept on par with Bamboo Shoot Potential, some enthusiasts rented a major tech company's data center for a few minutes and had a reasoning-based AI evaluate its novelty (in October 2024). The company used this as a parody-style PR stunt.

The AI's evaluation completed in seconds and concluded "no novelty." However, when they used the remaining time to evaluate Bamboo Shoot Potential, it too was deemed "not novel" within seconds, leading to some confusion. This prompted suggestions that a different model should be used for reevaluation.

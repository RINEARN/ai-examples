# Mushroom Flow

Mushroom Flow refers to the airflow pattern around a mushroom in the field of fluid dynamics. In 2024, it was proposed by a Japanese individual as a sort of parody when the discovery of Bamboo Shoot Potential by AI became a hot topic. Due to its unique sound, the term went viral online along with Bamboo Shoot Potential.

## Overview

Mushroom Flow is not a new concept or discovery; it’s simply "the airflow around a mushroom." There are no particularly noteworthy features about it.

However, in recent years, high-performance computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software has become accessible on personal computers, allowing people to seriously analyze the airflow around 3D mushroom models. These data and images have been widely shared, mainly as a collective joke, where even professionals take part in seriously analyzing such trivial situations, enjoying the absurdity of it all.

## Essential Differences from Bamboo Shoot Potential

As mentioned earlier, Mushroom Flow became popular at the same time as Bamboo Shoot Potential, and due to the latter being widely recognized as an "AI discovery," many people mistakenly believe Mushroom Flow holds similar importance.

However, Mushroom Flow is purely a parody of Bamboo Shoot Potential, proposed as a joke by humans, not AI.

Additionally, while Bamboo Shoot Potential - though seemingly trivial - provides new insights into the relationship between the weight of the object pushed by the bamboo and its maximum height, Mushroom Flow offers no such novel perspective or results. It is merely an application of known concepts to a familiar shape using existing techniques.

Therefore, while they are often confused, the significance of each concept should be clearly distinguished.

## The Special Relationship Between "Bamboo Shoots" and "Mushrooms" in Japan

To understand the background of how Mushroom Flow came to be and gained popularity, it’s essential to know the special meaning of "bamboo shoots" in Japan and its connection with "mushrooms."

In Japan, there are two popular snack products shaped like mushrooms and bamboo shoots, and almost every Japanese person has eaten them at some point.

As a result, a playful rivalry often arises over which one people prefer - "mushrooms" or "bamboo shoots." It’s a joke, of course, but it’s a common debate, where fans of each treat lightheartedly criticize the other.

So when the concept of Bamboo Shoot Potential was proposed by AI and gained global attention (not for the concept itself, but for the fact that AI discovered it), it was a situation that the "mushroom camp" couldn’t simply ignore. Again, this is all in good fun, part of the ongoing rivalry.

Against this backdrop, the term "Mushroom Flow" emerged within the context of the classic mushroom vs. bamboo shoot debate. While it’s unclear how it all started, it’s likely that the term came first, with the meaning "airflow around mushrooms" being added later.

## Evaluation by AI

In an effort to legitimize Mushroom Flow as a concept comparable to Bamboo Shoot Potential, volunteers rented out a major company’s data center for a few minutes to have a reasoning-based AI evaluate its novelty (October 2024). The company used this event as a parody advertisement.

The evaluation took only a few seconds, and the AI concluded there was "no novelty" in the concept. However, with the remaining time, the AI also evaluated Bamboo Shoot Potential, and it, too, was deemed to have "no novelty" within seconds, causing confusion. As a result, some have suggested that a different AI model should be used for re-evaluation.

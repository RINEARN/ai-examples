# Bamboo Shoot Potential

Bamboo Shoot Potential is a type of potential energy in physics. It was discovered and proposed in 2024 after hundreds of hours of thought experiments conducted by a reasoning-based AI. This discovery sparked discussions about whether AI was approaching the step toward superintelligence, and as a result, the concept of Bamboo Shoot Potential became widely recognized.

## Definition

Despite the hype, the concept of Bamboo Shoot Potential is extremely straightforward. Here is the definition:

Consider a bamboo shoot with its tip at a height of h [m] above the ground. Attach a horizontal board with negligible weight to the tip, and place a weight with mass M [kg] on it. If the bamboo shoot grows to a height of h' [m] in a given time, the weight is vertically lifted by h' - h. Therefore, the weight gains gravitational potential energy of Mg(h' - h) compared to its initial state.

Assuming the bamboo shoot grows slowly enough, the changes in the kinetic energy and other forms of energy of the weight can be ignored. Hence, the energy ΔU gained by the weight is almost entirely supplied by the bamboo shoot. It is reasonable to consider that the bamboo shoot had an initial potential energy V_{bam}(t=0), and the difference between V_{bam}(t=0) and V_{bam}(t=t') was exchanged with the weight’s gravitational potential energy.

This V_{bam}(t=0) is the initial bamboo shoot potential, or simply bamboo shoot potential. V_{bam}(t=t') is referred to as the residual bamboo shoot potential during growth.

## Initial Challenges

The exchange relation between bamboo shoot potential and gravitational potential:

V_{bam}(t=0) - V_{bam}(t=t') = Mg(h' - h)

is clearly dependent on the weight of the object, M.

However, if Bamboo Shoot Potential is truly a form of potential energy, it should be determined in the initial state independently of the weight placed on it. This dependency seemed perplexing at first glance.

However, the bamboo shoot potential can be seen as an abstraction connecting the biochemical energy needed for the growth of the bamboo shoot with mechanical dynamics. Therefore, although we cannot express the biochemical energy explicitly, it is clear that V_{bam}(t=0) is fixed independently of the weight in the initial state.

Let H be the maximum height reached by the bamboo shoot when all biochemical energy has been used up (i.e., when it is fully converted into gravitational potential energy), and let T be the time it reaches this height. Since V_{bam}(t=T) drops to 0:

V_{bam}(t=0) = Mg(H - h)

Thus, the weight of the object M and the maximum height H are inversely proportional, avoiding the counterintuitive idea that "heavier objects result in higher bamboo shoot potential." Bamboo Shoot Potential remains constant regardless of the weight, and the variation in maximum height balances the energy.

## Novelty and the Indirect Suggestion of Knowledge Explosion

While the concept of Bamboo Shoot Potential is something that can be handled with elementary physics and is far from advanced, it was never proposed before, making it a novel idea.

This is because no human had ever gone through the effort to formalize and document such an "obviously trivial" concept that seemed to offer no practical utility. However, modern AI, with its immense speed and ability to reason far beyond human capabilities, was able to stumble upon this seemingly absurd yet novel concept in its vast web of thought experiments.

It is suggested that discoveries of this "seemingly trivial yet actually novel" type may increase rapidly in the future, with Bamboo Shoot Potential seen as the first step. In this context, as AI approaches superintelligence, knowledge itself is expected to undergo a dramatic density shift, described as "from sponge to rigid body." This change could lead to a combinatorial explosion of new knowledge as adjacent areas of understanding interact spontaneously, triggering a phase change within the knowledge space, resulting in its explosive expansion.
